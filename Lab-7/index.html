          <h2>Biography</h2>
          My name is Harsh Agrawal, and I am a professional sleeper. I work as a luxury bed tester and sleeping on the job is a part of my job. I spend my days sleeping under different room conditions, followed by writing reviews and suggesting improvements. Often, I participate in experiments where I am "forced" to sleep for certain number of hours or even days! A group of doctors monitor my physical and mental states for changes. Besides the overall benefit of sleeping my days away, I help in actually improving products meant for comfort and in some cases advancing science! I earn around $1,200 per month on average, and upto $18,000 for 70 days worth of monitored experiments.
