        <h2>Don Bosco Senior Secondary School</h2>
        <p>
          My favourite class in the school was Maths. I was always quick at solving my problems, and it made me feel accomplished without having to put extra efforts learning.

          I remember participating in a lot of elocutions and skits during my time at Don Bosco. I remember the first time I got on stage, I was playing Mother Mary in a Christmas play - It was an all boys school - and I was terrified.  I jumbled up my lines, saw all my friends equally terrified messing up, but had a realization. No one except the people on stage knew the script, so everyone thought we had a flawless performance and enjoyed it anyways.

        <h2>SIES Graduate School of Technology</h2>
        <p>
          My favourite class in this school was Microcontroller hardware. I always thrilled seeing hardware act according to my code and figuring out why certain hardware doesn't was always fun.

          This was the first time, my parents allowed me to go on a week long trip with friends. The college industrial visit was some of the most fun I've ever had, from chilling with my guitar along the pond with my friends till 3am at night to partying hard till the last day, it was a bonding trip worth remembering for the rest of my life.

        <h2>DAV Public School</h2>
        <p>
          My favourite class was Structured Programming Approach (SPA). I could finally see the code that I write take shape and how it could potentially be used in the real world. I aced the project and the exam scoring full points in both.

          This was the first time I had participated in a hackathon. The topic was "Giving back" and we made a gesture controlled door. The night was spent playing cricket, celebrating birthdays and the next morning was spend preparing a presentation which eventually won us the prize.
