    <h1>That time I learnt how to love dogs.</h1>

        As a kid, I was always terrified of dogs. Where I used to live, there were dozens of stray dogs roaming around the place all day. They used to get especially loud and aggressive during the nights, following scooters and barking at them. I even remember incidents where I was chased by dogs and ended up hurting myself while running for my life.

        Naturally, I was afraid of dogs. One of my close friends from school had a huge black labrador named Buzo who used to bark at the doorbell terrifyingly loud. Whenever I used to go to his house to play videogames, his parents reluctantly tie the dog in the balcony. I felt bad for him, but the thought of letting him roam around in the house horrified me. One fine day, me and my friend were playing online games on Meta, when suddenly the dog entered our room. I was petrified. My friends parents stood outside the room watching, and as I started sweating, my friend's father said to me, "Don't be afraid, just sit still, he'll lick you, sit on your lap for a while, and go away when he's bored". The words made no sense to me, as I was trying to make no obvious moments as if trying to act dead in front of a bear. Slowly but surely, I starting relaxing and Buzo decided he wanted to sleep on my lap. As he lied there peacefully, I pet him, he licked my hand and that is how I learnt how to love dogs.

        It's been about 9 years since the incident, and I remember it fondly, as I've wanted to have a pet dog ever since. The day I realized, now matter how huge and scary, dogs are awesome.
